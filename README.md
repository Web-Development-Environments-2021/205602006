The site I built is about my husband's grandmother who is very important and loved by me.
The site contains:
	1. Information about her life and photos from the past and of her family
	2. A song she really likes
	3. answers for the questions askes at the assignment
	4. A way to contact me through my email and the option to add an emoji to the message

I hope you enjoy the site
